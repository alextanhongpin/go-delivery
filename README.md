## TODO

- add different delivery mechanism (mobile notification, browser notification, email, etc)
- create interface for the delivery and proper decoupling through design patterns
- track the type of notification sent and the open rate for delivery intelligence
- determine best sending time of the day
- multi-armed bandit to determine the best content
